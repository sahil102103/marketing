# Marketing Website
This is a README file for the marketing website I created from scratch in just a few hours. The purpose of creating this website was to pitch our final product for our second-semester marketing class project. To facilitate easy hosting, the website is hosted on GitHub.

# Introduction
As part of my second-semester marketing class, we were tasked with developing a final project and presenting our product idea. To effectively showcase our concept, I decided to create a simple website that would serve as a platform for presenting our final product.

# Technologies Used
This website was built from scratch using the following technologies:

- HTML
- CSS

# Getting Started
To run this website locally or host it on your own server, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/sahil102103/marketing.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd marketing-website
Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.

# Usage
Once you have the website open in your web browser, you can navigate through the different sections to learn more about our final product. The website is a product landing page which provides information about the product's features, benefits, and how it addresses the needs of our target market.

# Contributing
Since this project was created within a short timeframe for a specific class assignment, I am not accepting contributions.
